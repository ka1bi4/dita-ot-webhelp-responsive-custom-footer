# WebHelp Responsive customization plugin to change footer section

This is a sample WebHelp Customization plugin showing how you can transfer meta information specified in the DITA map to the WebHelp Responsive footer.

In this sample, the WebHelp Responsive footer is modified by adding copyright information extracted from the DITA bookmap or by adding the output generation time. The first use-case uses an XSLT-Import extension point while the second uses an XSLT-Parameter extension point.
